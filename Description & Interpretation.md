Target Variable:
    Study Hours: The total number of hours spent studying by each student.

The variable Extracurricular activities can be transformed into a categorical variable coded as 1 for yes and 0 for no.

By analyzing the boxplot of your continuous variables, we see no points that significantly deviate from the main distribution of the data. The "whiskers" represent the range of the IQR (Interquartile Range), which corresponds to the central half of the data. Therefore, the absence of points outside the whiskers suggests that there are no extreme outliers in your data.

Explained Deviance is the same as McFadden's Adjusted R2.

Based on all these results, we deduce that the model is adequate and of good quality.
